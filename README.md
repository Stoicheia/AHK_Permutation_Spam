# AHK_Permutation_Spam

Spam your friends with all permutations of a sentence/word. 

Edit the first array in the script (Right-click -> Open with -> Notepad or something) to choose strings to permute. 
(Default string: "clashing of the swords a nasheed of the defiant")

The program begins by saying how many permutations there are, and how long the whole process will approximately take. 
You should edit the equation for calculating time if you are permuting letters instead of words.

Press CTRL-J to start the program.
